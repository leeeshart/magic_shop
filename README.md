# ✨ Magic Shop ✨

**Magic Shop** is an AI-powered personalised learning chatbot that helps students learn in the best way for them. By understanding the learning style and cognitive preferences of each student, Magic Shop creates a personalised AI tutor, just for you !


## 🧩 Problem Statement

Just like you can’t expect a fish to climb a tree, education systems often expects all students to learn in same way.
Everyone has unique learning styles, some learn better visually, others by listening, or through stories and more. Your personality also shapes how you understand the information and process it (e.g., MBTIs like INTPs see the big picture, while INTJs are detail-oriented). When traditional teaching ignores these diverse needs, students struggles to engage and reach their potential.

**Magic Shop** solves this! with an AI tutor that adapts to YOU.


## 🌟 Project Overview

Magic Shop is an early-stage AI chatbot that makes learning personal for everyone:

- **Step 1:** Take a fun quiz to identify your learning style and MBTI personality type

- **Step 2:** View your personalized learning dashboard and about your MBTI

- **Step 3:** Talk to your personalized AI tutor 

Your AI knows your learning style and MBTI, and adapts how it explains

You can upload your notes (.txt) for AI to summarise just for you as per your learning preference.

Behind the scenes: Magic Shop uses Cloudflare Worker to securely call AI APIs (no keys in front-end!)


## 🚀 Features
