# Magic Shop

**Magic Shop** is an AI-powered chatbot that delivers truly personalized learning experiences. By understanding each learner's unique style and cognitive preferences, Magic Shop adapts how it teaches—making education engaging and effective for everyone.


## 🧩 Problem Statement

Just like you can’t expect a fish to climb a tree, education systems often fail by expecting all students to learn in the same way. Everyone has unique learning styles: some learn better visually, others by listening, or through stories. Cognitive preferences, like those identified by MBTI (e.g., INTPs see the big picture, while INTJs are detail-oriented), profoundly impact how information is best processed. When traditional teaching ignores these diverse needs, students get confused, struggle to grasp concepts, and find it difficult to engage—hindering their full potential.


## 🌟 Project Overview

Magic Shop is an early-stage AI chatbot that makes learning personal for everyone:
- **Personalized Onboarding:** Take a quiz to identify your learning style and MBTI personality type.
- **Tailored Interactions:** The chatbot adapts its teaching style—whether you’re a visual, auditory, or story-based learner, or have unique cognitive preferences.
- **Smart Content Summaries:** Upload your study notes or documents, and Magic Shop’s AI (powered by advanced models like OpenAI) will summarize content in a way that matches your learning style:
  - **Visual learners:** Receive mind maps or flowcharts.
  - **Auditory learners:** Get audio podcast summaries.
  - **Story-based learners:** Learn through simple stories and analogies.


## 🚀 Features
